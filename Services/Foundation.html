            will be good time visiting the local traditional food vendors who always
            delight in serving delicious local meals such as pounded yam using cocoyam
            with <strong>egunsi olokisi</strong> and bush meat to complement an undiluted palm wine! We
            understand that by taking in culture in any form whether it be music or art,
            we gain better understanding of humanity as a whole and of the groups we
            live amongst. As a result of this, culture can help break down
            boundaries, this is the focus of the cultural center! At the Ishaga Akiniyi

          <P>
            <li>THE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT/EMPOWERMENT CENTRE</li>
          </P>

            development and empowerment programs aimed at creating healthier and higher
            qualities of ife for underprivileged or at-risk youths. It is a general
            understanding that lack of skills is a major cause of corruption in any
            society hence the decision to have skills acquisition in five major sectors
            at the Femi Royal Foundation's acquisition center. The importance of this
            endeavor is to enable the beneficiaries be self-employed, have diverse job

          <p>B. Sports and Relaxation Arena</p>

          <p>The presence of sport arenas and stadiums play a significant role in defining the image of a kingdom like
            Ishaga Akiniyi Royal Kingdom. We understand that the presence of sport and relaxation arenas can act as a
            catalyst for the renewal of close neighborhoods. The arena will in ways help take the youths off crimes
            and the streets. The youths can engage their energy in sports and thereby discover their hidden talents.
            Sport arena's will also stimulate an economic growth and renewal in major ways like direct spending,
            multiplier benefits and indirect effects. At the kingdom four major sport arena shall be the focus namely:

            <p>

            <p>
              <li>Chinese Language</li>
            </p>
            <p>Learning Chinese language becomes more and more important with the growth of Chinese economy. There is
              about one fifth of the world populalation in China. The chinese are dominating globally in
              different segments like global business, industry and technology. Therefore training and learning
              Chinese language increases the economic worth of individuals. To expand its global influence, China is
              investing heavily in developing nations around the world. The rise of China has brought about the
              necessity for more Chinese language speakers across the globe and especially in Africa where China is
              making serious inroads.</p>
